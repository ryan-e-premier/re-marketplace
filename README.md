### 📋 plan-review

Interactive section-by-section review of Claude Code plan files. Walk through
a plan, ask questions, and apply edits mid-review — with an optional tmux
popup mode that mirrors the diff-review experience.

**Command:** `/stn:plan-review [path]`

**Features:**

- Discovers plans from both local `.claude/plans/` and global
  `~/.claude/plans/`, displayed in labelled groups
- **Popup mode** (tmux + neovim) — one section per popup with keybinds:
  Enter=next, p=prev, q=ask, e=change, d=done
- **Conversational mode** — sections shown in chat, navigate by typing
- Ask questions mid-review; answer shown in chat before popup reopens
- Propose and apply edits inline with before/after confirmation
- Jump navigation and changelog summary at wrap-up

### 🔧 fix-pr-interactive

Interactively review and address GitHub PR feedback one comment at a time.
Each comment is shown with full code context before you decide to fix,
respond, defer, or skip it.

**Command:** `/stn:fix-pr-interactive [PR_NUMBER]`

**Features:**

- Presents each PR comment with surrounding code context and diff hunk
- Groups duplicate/similar comments so identical feedback is handled once
- Session persistence — resume mid-session if context is lost
- Skips already-addressed comments (detects AI reply marker from prior runs)
- Commit-per-fix workflow with immediate push for reviewer visibility
- Defers comments to a local markdown file for later review
- Posts GitHub replies with AI attribution prefix

### 📸 add-ss

Capture Chrome screenshots and add them to the `## Screenshots` section of
the open or draft PR for the current branch.

**Command:** `/stn:add-ss [tab description]`

**Features:**

- Auto-detects the open or draft PR for the current branch via `gh pr view`
- Verifies a Screenshots heading exists in the PR body before proceeding
- Lists open Chrome tabs and lets you pick one or more to capture
- Captures pages via `javascript_tool` + html2canvas — no imageId expiry
- Commits screenshots to `.github/screenshots/pr-{number}/` and references
  them via `raw.githubusercontent.com`
- Updates the PR description via `gh api PATCH` — no web UI editing
- Always confirms before making the API call
